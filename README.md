# Joytag Caption - Batch
This tool utilizes the Joytag Caption tool (still in Pre-Alpha), to caption image files in a batch.

Simply place all images you wish to caption in the /input directory and run `py batch.py`.

# Setup
1. Download the [image_adapter.pt](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fancyfeast/joy-caption-pre-alpha/tree/main/wpkklhc6) and place it in the `wpkklhc6` directory.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for your setup. Feel free to use the `venv_create.bat` for a simple windows setup.
3. (Optional) Activate your venv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
